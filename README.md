Droplets focuses on the development of a cloud application,
in support with OpenStack, to host a searching service for 
hospitalized patients to increase the chances of finding 
blood donors.
The idea its to make matches between these two actors, 
as well as the integration of a reward system to compensate 
donors for their effort & participation. The main benefit 
will be the reduction of the timespan a patient have to 
wait for a blood transfusion.
